Hi, 

This is P.Kunal and this is a readme describing the project structure of the Graded Assignment 3 - Spring ORM & MVC Assignment Solution as I faced some trouble while working on the project which I wasn't entirely able to resolve on my own.

P.S: 

1.Although I faced some difficulties in the project curation, using the knowledge of building a similar project in the Weekly Lab sessions, I was able to successfully create a FULLY WORKING PROJECT as was required in the problem statement. 

2.Kindly ignore the "student" parts in the code, as I had to take parts of code from a previous application I built which didn't have any errors and repurpose it for this assignment to finish the project within the deadline. 

3.Yet the code works exactly as we wanted it to with the details of a customer being stored in a database and performing exactly as was required in the problem statement.

4.If the database entries don't show up, kindly use the password and username you have set up for your mySQL client. I had to change the password to protect the privacy and security of the password (in the 'applicationContext.xml' file I have changed it to the default password i.e. 'admin' for public github upload). As you can see in the screenshots.pdf I have provided, the program works perfectly fine and works with the database on my system.
